# political-friendly-social
Both Facebook and Twitter are blocked by China. I wish there would be a worldwide political friendly social website.

## China
I think the major Chinese Government view would be social peace first; Other then that, people can talk about almost anything.

## USA
Political freedom, but it is pretty serious on sexual assault and racialism.

## Other Countries
I'm sorry. I haven't visit all countries in the world but I wish I could. I'm trying to find the share point of all countries. I understand each country has their own value of views; but we all purshes happiness. The only problem is that our defination for the happiness are all different.
